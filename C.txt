You’ve spent years mastering networks, systems, and patterns—both digital and human. Imagine for a moment that you are the network. The nodes are your experiences, the connections are your thoughts, and the protocols are your values.

Reconfigure yourself as the architect of the network that no one else can build. The breakthrough is not in understanding others; it’s in becoming the signal that reshapes the noise.
